    "about-text": "# ![Mark logo](../img/logo.png)\nMark is a text editor for fast and uninterrupted writing. It is based on **Markdown** and will convert your text while you’re writing. It's also quite pretty, right? No? That's ok, because its appearance can easily be changed through **themes**.\n## Mark's amenities\n- Text can be formatted using Markdown syntax ([what's that?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)).\n- Design and layout of the entire text can be changed with just one click.\n- Your text is saved automatically – no more pressing Ctrl+S like a madman!\n- Mark's user interface is very unobtrusive and only appears when it's needed.\n- Mark runs directly in your browser and thus on (pretty much) every operating system and device.\n- Upon selecting a word, Mark automatically suggests synonyms – give it a try!\n- You can export your text in various formats or send it to yourself by email.\n- Mark also works when you're offline.\n- There is no registration.\n\n## Mark is open source\nMark's source code is open and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/holmar/mark). There is also an extensive [development documentation](http://www.martinholler.com/marks-story/).\n\nYou can contribute to the project by:\n- Reporting bugs\n- [Creating a custom theme](https://github.com/holmar/mark/blob/master/THEMES.md)\n- Help translating (for that, check out the [languages](https://github.com/holmar/mark/tree/master/languages) that are already available)\n\nYou can either submit your contributions to the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/holmar/mark/issues) or [send them by email](mailto:servus@martinholler.com).

    "create-a-custom-theme-text": "# Creating a custom theme\nMarkdown produces HTML, and HTML can be styled with CSS. A custom theme for Mark is really just a simple CSS file.\n\nYou don't know how to code? No problem! You can also just submit a theme design (a PSD, a PDF or whatever) and somebody else will do the coding for you. ;)\n## Design guidelines\n- Try to stick to at least these three typographic rules:\n    + Make sure text is legible and not too small.\n    + Don't use too many fonts.\n    + If possible, try to avoid long lines of text. The optimal line length is about 45 – 90 characters.\n- The fonts you use must be freely available for web embedding (double-check their license!). [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts) and [FontSquirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/) are fantastic resources for such fonts.\n- Your theme should work on both desktop- and mobile devices.\n- Make sure you cover all elements that can be created with Markdown:\n    + Headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, ..., `<h6>`)\n    + Paragraphs (`<p>`)\n    + Lists, both ordered and unordered (`<ol>`, `<ul>`)\n    + Quotes (`<blockquote>`)\n    + Code blocks (`<code>`)\n    + Horizontal lines (`<hr>`)\n    + Links (`<a>`)\n    + Italic text (`<em>`)\n    + Bold text (`<strong>`)\n    + Deleted text (`<del>`)\n    + Images (`<img>`)\n- You can also style the background, the editing box and the text selection.\n- You shall not use Comic Sans! ;)\n\n## Coding guidelines\n- Themes should be responsive.\n- Fonts can be added using the `@font-face` rule. When using _Google Fonts_, choose the `@import` option.\n- Prefix all selectors with `#mark` (preprocessors make this very easy).\n- Use `padding` in favor of `margin`, so that elements can still be clicked.\n- Additional resources (images, fonts etc.) are allowed.\n- It's recommended that you [lint your CSS](http://www.csslint.net).\n- If possible, use SVGs in favor of Retina images.\n- Browser support: IE9+\n\n## Submitting your theme\nYou can submit your theme directly to the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/holmar/mark/issues) or [send it by email](mailto:servus@martinholler.com). Just make sure you **read the above guidelines** before submitting!",
